### Version 1.0.1 - 2024-1-15
- Added feature dual camera system

### Version 1.0.0 - 2023-08-15
- Initial release



This is a modular automated microscope project.

It is designed to build a modular and automated microscope system that is easy to integrate and assemble. The software part includes features such as autofocus and automatic microbial identification using built-in recognition models.

# Function introduction:

- 1Provides automatic autofocus function.
- 2Automatically plans the path based on the actual scanned area (in mm).
- 3Multiple autofocus modes: single autofocus for full-slide scanning, autofocus for each scan in region scanning, and intelligent autofocus.
- 4dual camera system


Firstly, you must have the supported hardware: a camera and a modular motorized microscope. 

Secondly, you need to place the model in the model/ directory (model download link: link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1V6RZauGDAlvvb9XeouCPqw?pwd=1234 
The extraction code：1234). 
Of course, you can also train your own model according to your needs.


The software interface is as follows:
